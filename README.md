# Crowd Detection Results  

A project for detecting and analyzing crowd density using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.  

**Key Features:**  
- Focused on `person` detection.  
- Achieves 92% accuracy with a custom dataset of 10,000 images.  
- Applications include real-time crowd analysis in metro stations and other public spaces.  

**Check It Out:**  
You can test the model on our deployed Streamlit app: [Crowd Detection Test](https://persondetect.streamlit.app/)
